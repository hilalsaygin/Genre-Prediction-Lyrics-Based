## **Introduction**  
Focuses on **lyrics-based genre classification**, leveraging both **textual and structural** properties of song lyrics to enhance classification accuracy. Unlike traditional methods that treat lyrics as a uniform text block, this approach prioritizes **song composition**, particularly **chorus sections**, to evaluate their impact on prediction performance.  

A **novel dataset** was created using **Genius.com** and **HuggingFace**, incorporating **section-level labels** such as chorus, verse, and intro. The dataset was then segmented into **chorus and non-chorus subsets** to enable comparative analysis of their contributions to classification accuracy.  

A **custom feature extraction system** was developed, integrating **textual, semantic, and stylistic features** such as:  
‚úî **TF-IDF, word embeddings, and n-grams**  
‚úî **Rhyme patterns and sentiment analysis**  
‚úî **Grammatical properties and structural metrics**  

The extracted feature sets were transformed into **sparse matrix representations** and evaluated using **Random Forest, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression models**. Experiments were conducted by training models on:  
- **Chorus-only lyrics**  
- **Non-chorus lyrics**  
- **Combined data with weighted contributions**  

The results demonstrated that **prioritizing chorus features significantly improved classification accuracy**, with the **best-performing configuration achieving ~60-61% accuracy** using **Random Forest**. This work highlights the importance of **structural elements in lyrics classification** and provides a **scalable framework** for integrating structural properties into text-based classification tasks.

The key objectives of this research are:  
- **Investigate the role of chorus structures** in genre prediction  
- **Develop a dataset** that segments lyrics into structured sections  
- **Implement feature engineering techniques** to extract meaningful patterns  
- **Evaluate multiple classification models** and compare their performances  

By addressing these goals, this study contributes to **music information retrieval, recommendation engines, and text classification applications** beyond the music industry.

## **Dataset Construction**  
The dataset was built by combining lyrics from:  
- **Genius.com** (crowdsourced lyrics with section labels)  
- **HuggingFace** (lyric datasets for NLP research)  

Each song was **annotated with structural labels** (e.g., `[Chorus]`, `[Verse]`, `[Intro]`), allowing segmentation into distinct subsets:  
‚úî **Chorus** lyrics  
‚úî **Non-chorus** lyrics  
‚úî **Full lyrics (combined & weighted for impact analysis)**  

To ensure **genre balance**, the dataset was curated to **contain a uniform distribution** of genres, preventing model bias.

## **Feature Extraction**  
A **custom feature extraction pipeline** was developed to capture different aspects of lyrics:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Features**  
- **Word frequency, lexical diversity, punctuation ratios**  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Features**  
- **Word embeddings** using **Word2Vec**  
- **TF-IDF & Bag-of-Words** models  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Structural Features**  
- **Rhyme patterns, sentiment scores, stylistic metrics**  
- **Chorus vs. non-chorus weighting** for comparative analysis  

The extracted features were transformed into **sparse matrices** for machine learning models.

## **Experimental Setup**  
To analyze the impact of **chorus prioritization**, multiple training configurations were tested:  

‚úî **Model trained on chorus data only**  
‚úî **Model trained on non-chorus data only**  
‚úî **Model trained on combined data (with different weightings for chorus and non-chorus features)**  
‚úî **Feature engineering variations (TF-IDF vs. embeddings, rhyme patterns, sentiment analysis, etc.)**  
‚úî **Dimensionality reduction using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**  

The following **machine learning models** were used:  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes**  
- **Logistic Regression**  

Metrics for evaluation:  
‚úî **Accuracy**  
‚úî **Precision, Recall, F1-score**  
‚úî **Comparison of feature contributions (chorus vs. non-chorus)**
